# Reporting Vulnerabilities

The Tasktix team takes security issues in Tasktix very seriously. We appreciate your
efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge
your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory "Report a
Vulnerability" tab. To protect fellow users' security to the greatest extent possible,
please **do not** create an Issue or public release for the vulnerability until a patch is
widely available.

The Tasktix team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report.
After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the
progress towards a fix and full announcement. We may ask for additional information or
guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.
You can also report a vulnerability through the npm contact form by selecting "I'm
reporting a security vulnerability".
